[done]:
1. Built up REINFORCE model w/o BASELINE;
2. Created util script for handling state representation;

[problem]
Neither of REINFORCE w/o BASELINE works

[plan]
Try A2C tomorrow

2019-04-07
[done]:
1. tried REINFORCE with small lr and more hidden layers;
2. changed reward to be partial;
3. built up A2C model but didn't find good hyper params that can converge

[problem]:
1. although performance of REINFORCE is better than yesterday's
   divergence, it still doesn't works
2. A2C doesn't converge either

[plan]
try one hot representation
tune hyper params

2019-04-08
[done]:
1. built up one_hot representation method in preprocessor;
2. tried one_hot representation with REINFORCE and A2C;

[problem]:
1. although the message is perfect, neither A2C or REINFORCE could solve
   the game;

[plan]
