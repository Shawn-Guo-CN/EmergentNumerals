\section{Final Reminder}

The body of your dissertation, before the references and any appendices,
\emph{must} finish by page~40. The introduction, after preliminary material,
should have started on page~1.

You may not change the dissertation format (e.g., reduce the font
size, change the margins, or reduce the line spacing from the default
1.5 spacing). Over length or incorrectly-formatted dissertations will
not be accepted and you would have to modify your dissertation and
resubmit.  You cannot assume we will check your submission before the
final deadline and if it requires resubmission after the deadline to
conform to the page and style requirements you will be subject to the
usual late penalties based on your final submission time.
